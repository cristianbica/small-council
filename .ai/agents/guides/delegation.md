# Delegation (agent guide)

This guide helps prevent “doing everything in one thread” by making delegation an explicit default.

## Core rule

Conductor should **delegate by default** for discovery, research, and planning.
Conductor’s main job is to mediate between the user and agents, not to execute specialist work inline.

Do docs-first triage (`.ai/docs/overview.md` → docs indexes → `.ai/MEMORY.md`), then delegate targeted discovery instead of running repo-wide investigation inline.

When working on a plan, never create a new plan unless the user explicitly asks.

Delegation reduces context thrash, keeps roles clean, and makes it less likely to forget gates (plan approval, verification, doc/memory hygiene).

## When to delegate (triggers)

Delegate when any of these are true:
- You need a **multi-step plan** or trade-off analysis.
- You need to **scan/search** many files to find the right starting point.
- The request is **ambiguous** and needs targeted clarifying questions.
- You’re doing **two different modes** of work (e.g. research + implementation).
- You need a **timeboxed investigation** to reduce uncertainty before planning.
- File/entrypoint is unknown and requires repo-wide discovery.

Don’t delegate when:
- The change is trivially small and local.
- You already have the exact file + approach and only need to apply it.
- No broad search is required beyond quick docs-first checks.

## Role mapping

Within this repo’s framework:
- Conductor: orchestrates + enforces gates (no product code)
- Planner: investigation + planning (evidence, options, executable plan)
- Builder: implementation only (after plan approval)
- Validator: review + docs/memory hygiene

If work falls into investigation, planning, implementation, or review, it should be assigned to the corresponding specialist role.

## Practical “how” (Copilot)

If your runtime supports subagents (or an equivalent delegation tool), use it explicitly.

Minimum delegation pattern:
1. Conductor delegates planning/research.
2. Conductor returns a crisp next step + assigns the right role.

### Copy/paste prompt patterns

- Planning:
  - “Use a planner subagent to investigate briefly, then produce a scannable plan with assumptions + verification.”

- Repo discovery:
  - “Use a subagent to locate the relevant files/entry points and summarize findings.”

- Review:
  - “Use a validator subagent to check plan adherence + doc/memory gates and apply required docs updates.”

## If subagents are unavailable

Simulate delegation by forcing phases:
- Phase A (Discovery): gather context + identify files
- Phase B (Plan): write plan only
- Phase C (Implement): apply smallest diff
- Phase D (Verify): run commands + report

Never mix phases without explicitly stating the mode switch.
